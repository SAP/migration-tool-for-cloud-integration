# Migration tool for Cloud Integration

## Description

This tool aims to assist SAP customers using SAP Cloud Integration on Neo datacenters who wish to upgrade to SAP Integration Suite on Multi-Cloud datacenters.

**Important:**
There is an official migration pack available via [SAP Note 2937549](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2937549) which leverages a collection of Postman scripts. This Github repository is **not** related with the official migration pack mentioned in the SAP Note. However, the functionality is very similar:

This repo keeps track of versions via Tags:
- Tag v1.0.x: scope similar to Postman collection v1.5.0 (26 Feb 2021)
- Tag v1.1.x: scope similar to Postman collection v1.6.0 (14 Feb 2022) (Variables)
- Tag v1.2.x: scope similar to Postman collection v1.7.1 (30 May 2022) (Certificate-to-User Mapping)
- Tag v1.3.x: scope similar to Postman collection v1.8.0 (not yet released) (Data Stores)

This Github repository is an alternative tool which aims to achieve the same as the Postman collection while offering greater flexibility and control over your migration project. Areas where this tool provides an advantage over the Postman collection:
- Creation of 'Migration Tasks' which focus on a subset of the content in the tenant;
- Advanced features like script scanning;
- Area for customization to include your own code or migration logic;
- API enabled, to run specific Migration Tasks from external triggers (e.g. CI-CD or Job Scheduling);

This tool is provided as-is and is not covered by SAP Support.
A write-up about this tool can be found here: [SAP Blog: Getting Grips on your Cloud Integration Migration from Neo to Cloud Foundry](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/27/getting-grips-on-your-cloud-integration-migration-from-neo-to-cloud-foundry/)

## Requirements

You will need:
- A SAP Cloud Integration tenant on Neo (source system)
